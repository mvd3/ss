This is a project that I did for my exam. It's a chain of tools for assembling, linking and emulating code for an simplified computer system.

zadatak1 -> Assembler

zadatak2 -> Linker

zadatak3 -> Emulator

Each folder has the same structure, inc and src contain the source code, makefile for creating an executable and test contains some basic tests.
